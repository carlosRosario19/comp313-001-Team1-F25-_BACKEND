# Running the Application

This guide explains how to run the application locally using a containerized database with either **Docker Compose** or **Podman Compose**. 

It includes instructions for **Linux**, **macOS**, and **Windows**.

---

## Prerequisites

- **Docker** or **Podman** installed on your system.  
- **Java 25** installed.  

---

## Starting the Application

### 1. Start the Database

You need to start the database containers in detached mode:

- **Using Docker Compose**
  ```bash
  docker compose up -d
  ```
 
- **Using Podman Compose**
  ```bash
  docker compose up -d
  ```

### 2. Start the Spring Boot Application

Run the Spring Boot application using the Maven Wrapper:

- **Linux / macOS**
  ```bash
  ./mvnw spring-boot:run
  ```
  
- **Windows (PowerShell or CMD)**
  ```bash
  mvnw spring-boot:run
  ```

## Stopping the Application

### 1. Stop the Spring Boot App

Press ``CTRL + C`` in the terminal where the application is running.
This will gracefully terminate the Spring Boot process.

### 2. Stop the Database

Once youâ€™re done, stop and remove the database containers:

- **Using Docker Compose**
  ```bash
  docker compose down -v
  ```

- **Using Podman Compose**
  ```bash
  podman compose down -v
  ```
  
The ``-v`` option removes the associated volumes (for example, database data), ensuring a clean state for the next run.
